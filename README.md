Extensions / Unsolved Issues

1. Maximum length of order is 16 ingredients. Enable automatic scrolling downward if order exceeds height of the order list?
2. Switch from fixed pixel values for width/height to % to allow resizing of window
3. Use opacity % instead of height:0px to collapse/expand overlay panels.
4. Onion does not stack as nicely compared to other ingredients. Tweak positioning or negative margins.
